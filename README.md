A Travelling Salesman Problem Implementation (TSA) using a Genetic Algorithm

This was a scholar project durint the 3rd year of my Bachelor degree

I didn't have time to revise it. It was my very first hello world in java because I learned java on the go while working on this project

It works well and has a simple GUI to generate a problem and set the solution parameters.
